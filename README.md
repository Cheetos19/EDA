## Introduction

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is essential for any data-driven project. It allows you to understand your data's structure and uncover insights before diving into more complex analyses. This repository contains tools and scripts that facilitate EDA, making it easier for data scientists and analysts to visualize and interpret data.

## Topics Covered

This repository includes a wide range of topics relevant to EDA:

- **Data**: Understanding data types and structures.
- **Data Analysis**: Techniques for analyzing data effectively.
- **Data Engineering**: Preparing data for analysis.
- **Data Science**: Applying scientific methods to extract knowledge from data.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating visual representations of data.
- **Database**: Working with databases to store and retrieve data.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Libraries for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- **NumPy**: A library for numerical computations.
- **Pandas**: A library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: A library for machine learning.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Techniques for analyzing time-dependent data.

## Installation

To get started with this repository, you need to install the required libraries. You can do this using pip. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can check your Python version by running:

```bash
python --version
```

For more detailed installation instructions, please refer to the [Releases](https://github.com/Cheetos19/EDA/releases) section.

## Usage

Once you have installed the necessary libraries, you can start using the scripts in this repository. Each script is designed to perform specific tasks in EDA. Here are a few examples:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Use the `data_cleaning.py` script to clean your dataset.
2. **Visualization**: Use the `visualization.py` script to create plots and charts.
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Use the `statistical_analysis.py` script to perform various statistical tests.

You can run these scripts from the command line. For example:

```bash
python data_cleaning.py
```

Make sure to replace `data_cleaning.py` with the name of the script you wish to execute.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Each script comes with detailed comments explaining the code.
- **Examples**: Sample datasets are provided for testing and learning.
- **Modular Code**: The code is organized into functions for easier understanding and reuse.
- **Visualizations**: Create a variety of plots to understand your data better.
